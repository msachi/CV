- an autocomplete search app ([GitHub](https://github.com/NodeGroup2/autocomplete-project))
- an app that uses machine learning APIs to analyse images ([GitHub](https://github.com/FAC9/gitbusters_api))
- an app that searches for recipes and provides grocery ingredient lists ([GitHub](https://github.com/NodeGroup2/GRAGS))
- a CMS app for storing and sharing coding resources ([GitHub](https://github.com/NodeGroup2/OCD-B))
- an app that manages information on GitHub issues ([GitHub](https://github.com/seals-of-approval/dish-board))
- an app that helps young people with low self esteem ([GitHub](https://github.com/CYPIAPT-LNDSE/social-up) - in progress)
